**Figure 3.** Fig. 3. The microbial variation by race and douching and its interference with microbial signatures associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). (a) PCoA ordination colored by race and douching for samples (n=489) with douching information available. (b) Vagitype composition of douching and non-douching Black and White women. Significance was determined with Fisherâ€™s exact test. (c) Shannon diversity, L. crispatus and L. iners abundance by race and douching groups. The Shannon diversity, L. crispatus and L. iners abundance were significantly different for no douching White women compared to the other three groups. Shannon diversity was analyzed with Wilcoxon test and the taxa abundance was analyzed with ALDEx2. (d) Comparison of microbial species associated with race in douching and no douching participants. The x-axis is -log10(P) of the associations between each taxon and race with ALDEx2in douching group, multiplied by the direction of changes, while the y-axis is in no douching group. (e) Comparison of microbial species associated with douching in Black and White participants. The x-axis is -log10(P) of the associations between each taxon and douching with Wilcoxon test in Black women, multiplied by the direction of changes, while the y-axis is in White women. (f) PERMANOVA tests of the associations between microbiome and term/sPTB birth in each of the race and douching groups.
