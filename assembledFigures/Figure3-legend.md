**Figure 3.** The microbial variation by race and douching and its interference with microbial signatures associated with spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). (a) PCoA ordination colored by race and douching. (b) Vagitype composition of douching and non-douching black and white women. Significance was determined with Fisher’s exact test. (c) Shannon diversity, _L. crispatus_ and _L. iners_ abundance by race and douching groups. The Shannon diversity, _L. crispatus_ and _L. iners_ abundance were significantly different for no douching white women compared to the other three groups, estimated with Tukey’s HSD test. (d) Comparison of microbial species associated with race in douching and no douching participants. (e) Comparison of microbial species associated with douching in black and white participants. P-values were calculated with Wilcoxon tests. Species with FDR < 0.1 were labeled. (f) PERMANOVA tests of term/SPTB birth in each of the race and douching groups.
