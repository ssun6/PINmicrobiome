**Figure 1.** Fig. 1. The associations of vaginal microbiome, race and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). PCoA ordination of the vaginal microbiome colored by race (a) and term/sPTB (b). The ellipse indicates a 95% confidence limit of the centroid calculated with the function ‘ordiellipse’ in R package ‘vegan’. (c) The effect sizes (R2) of host factors with PERMANOVA tests. (d) The associations between race and Shannon diversity, L. iners and L. crispatus. (e) The associations between sPTB and Shannon diversity, L. iners and L. crispatus. Y-axes show the Shannon diversity and log10 of normalized relative abundance for L. iners and L. crispatus (see methods). Significance was determined by Wilcoxon test for Shannon diversity and ALDEx2 for L. iners and L. crispatus.
