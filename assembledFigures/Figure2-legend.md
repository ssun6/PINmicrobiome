**Figure 2.**  The vagitypes and their associations with preterm birth. (a) The vaginal microbiota of study participants showed discrete taxonomic composition that can be classified to vagitypes. (b) The PCoA ordination of the vaginal microbiota colored by vagitypes. (c) The PCoA ordination of the vaginal microbiota colored by race and term/spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). (d) The percentage of SPTB in each of the vagitypes. Significance was determined with Fisher’s exact test. (d) Shannon diversity of the vagitypes. The Shannon diversity of L.crispatus vagitype was significantly lower than the other three vagitypes, estimated with Tukey HSD test. (f) Vagitype composition of black and white women. (g) The percentage of SPTB associated with L.crispatus and L.iners vagitypes in black and white women. Significance was determined with Fisher’s exact test.
