## Transparency and Reproducibility

This repository contains:         

 * Counts files produced by processing the sequences, see folder: `data`
 * Configuration file to run the analysis component of the project, including all Rcode, see folder: `BioLockJ`
 * Results of the analysis (figures and tables), see folder: `results`
 
See `BioLockJ/README` for instructions on how to repeat the entire analysis on your own machine, thus reproducing all figures and tables.  A review module was added to the pipeline to facilitate readers and reviewers comparing the reproduced output the the corresponding components in the manuscript.

## Abstract
Previous studies have investigated the associations between the vaginal microbiome and preterm birth (PTB), with the aim of determining whether differences in community patterns meaningfully alter risk, and could therefore be the target of intervention. We report on vaginal microbial analysis on a subset of the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition (PIN) Study, a prospectively enrolled cohort of women in central North Carolina between 1995-2000. We selected a nested case-control subset of this cohort, including 464 White women (375 term birth and 89 spontaneous PTB, sPTB) and 360 Black women (276 term birth and 84 sPTB). Microbial DNA was extracted from genital track swabs collected mid-pregnancy, and subjected to 16S taxonomic profiling. We found that microbial community structure is associated with race and sPTB, although the influence of race is stronger than the influence of sPTB. The microbiome of Black women has higher alpha-diversity, higher abundance of L. iners and lower abundance of L. crispatus. These differences were obscured once maternal douching behavior was consideredâ€”specifically, among women who douche, there were no material differences in microbiome by race. The sPTB associated microbiome exhibited a lower abundance of L. crispatus, while alpha diversity and L. iners were not significantly different. Associations between the microbiome and sPTB were only significant in women who do not douche. While race was a strong predictor of microbial community structure, we also observed strong intercorrelations between a range of maternal factors, including poverty, education, marital status, age, douching and race, with microbiome effect sizes in the range of 1.8-5.2% in univariate models. Therefore race may simply be a marker for other socially driven factors that differentiate microbiome community structures. Future work will continue to refine reliable microbial biomarkers for preterm birth across diverse cohorts.
